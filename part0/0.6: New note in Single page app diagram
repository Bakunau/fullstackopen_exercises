1. The user interacts with the SPA frontend, which displays existing notes and provides a form for creating new notes.
2. Then the user performs an action -> clicking a button to create a new note, an event handler in the frontend captures the event.
3. The event handler triggers an HTTPrequest to the server, using the POST method, sending the note data.
4. The server receives the request at an appropriate API endpoint, processes the data, and stores it in a database or some form of persistent storage.
5. The server responds with an HTTP response, typically confirming the successful creation of the note.
6. The frontend receives the response and updates the interface accordingly, often by dynamically rendering the new note (without requiring a full page reload!).
7. The user sees the updated interface in their browser, showing the newly created note along with all existing notes.
